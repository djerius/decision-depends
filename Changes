Revision history for Perl extension Decision::Depends.

0.02_02	2016-02-16T11:53:32-0500

   [ BUILD ]
      * tests assumed availability of rm executable and POSIX style shell. Oops.

0.20_01  2016-02-14T12:22:04-0500

   [ BUILD ]
      * t/parse.t relied upon hash order
      * modernized build infrastructure to use cpanfile
      * author tests moved to xt/


0.20  2008-08-29T17:16:46-0500
        - work around feature in Test::More 0.80 which caused variable
	  hash test to fail.

0.19  2008-03-04T09:49:55-0500
        - new variable dependency code didn't work; fix it and tests
	  which didn't show failure.

0.18  2008-03-03T-14:44:09-0500
        - Variable dependencies may now be hashes and arrays as well
	  as scalars.

0.17  2005-09-20T15:46:20-0500
        - Test::More::eq_hash (v0.6) is more thorough than v0.47,
	  which broke t/sig.t
	- useless (and incorrect) deletion of attributes in t/traverse.t
	  led to warning

0.16  2003-07-13T16:15:43-0500

        - verbose output is sent to STDOUT now.

0.15  2003-06-26T13:32:43-0500

        - added hash ref means of associating attribute values and
	  ordinary values
	- modified variable dependencies so can find name of variable
	  in attribute value.  this allows easy specification of
	  variable names and values via the hashref method above.

0.14  2003-01-22T00:17:32-0500

        - AutoSave option was undocumented and no longer needed.
	- Added warning about absolute path for dependency file to docs.

0.13  2003-01-21T13:54:33-0500

        - needed to bump up Carp::CarpLevel at the Depends.pm level.

0.12  2003-01-11T00:39:02-0500

        - Force had no effect if a target had no dependencies.
	- added force attribute to targets

0.11  2002-12-31T10:56:58-0500

        - Yikes. was developing with older version of YAML;
	  latest version has DumpFile, not StoreFile.
	  require YAML 0.35

0.10  2002-12-31T10:21:56-0500

        - release to CPAN.  Now called Decision::Depends.
	  no more 'use Depends'. awww.

0.09  2002-04-10T10:20:48-0500

        - variable dependencies now try to guess if the value is a
	  number and perform a numeric comparison.  This may be
	  forced or overridden with the new -numcmp and -strcmp attributes.
	- documented variable dep. -case attribute.
	- added Depends::renew() for testing purposes.
	- removed dependency Attr hashes; they should all use State
	  Attrs via State methods.


0.08  2002-04-02T01:08:18-0500

        - test for dependency existance in Time->new didn't
	  check the State cache (good when Pretend => 1 ).
	  it seems to be a duplicate check, as it's also done
	  (correctly) in Time->depends.  So, yank the check in new().

0.07  2002-04-01T00:00:00-0500
        - configure is more flexible in regards to the form of its
	  arguments
	- OO::new was calling (via configure) $self->{State}->SetAttr
	  before $self->{State} was created.
	- Target::mkSFile wasn't correctly updating the modify time
	  if the sfile already existed.

0.06  2002-03-27T20:24:27-0500
        - State->getVar was incorrectly treating variables
	  with values of 0 as being undefined.  oops.

0.05  2002-03-25T13:22:33-0500

        - first recasting of top level Depends interface into OO
          module by moving most of the front end code into Depends::OO.
          Depends.pm now is just a wrapper around Depends::OO.

	- Depends::init superceded by Depends::Configure.

	- added Force and -force global and local attributes to force
	  dependencies to be out of date.

	- no longer use File::stat, as it causes conniptions for
	  testing under 5.6.1.

0.04  2002-03-21T19:48:11-0500
        - added test_dep()

0.03  2002-03-07T16:45:04-0500
        - further message tweaks.
	- Verbose > 4 gives object creation messages.
	- must have broken non-existant signature and variable code,
	  cause it didn't work.  does now.

0.02  2002-03-06T12:07:20-0500
        - uses YAML instead of Data::Denter, as had corruption
	  problems with the latter
        - minor error message tweaks

0.01  2002-02-04T11:26:18-0500
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-n Depends -A -X
